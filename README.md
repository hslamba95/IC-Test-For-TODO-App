# TODO List Canister for the Internet Computer
This is a Motoko codebase for a simple TODO list canister that can be deployed to the Internet Computer (IC). It allows users to add, read, update, and delete TODO items.

## Features:

- Add new TODO items
- Read existing TODO items by ID
- Update TODO items by ID
- Delete TODO items by ID
- Check if there are any TODO items present

###Getting Started

#### Dependencies: 
This code requires the ic_cdk library. Ensure you have it installed following the Motoko development documentation: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/home

####Building: 
Use dfx build to build the canister:

####Bash
``` dfx build ```

Use code with caution.

####Deploying:
Deploy the canister to the IC using dfx deploy. You'll need an IC identity and cycles for deployment.

#### Using the Canister

This canister exposes several query functions that can be called from other canisters or user interfaces:

- add_todo_endpoint(text: String): Adds a new TODO item with the provided text. Returns a confirmation message with the ID of the added item.
- read_todo_by_id_endpoint(id: String): Reads a TODO item by its ID. Returns a string containing the item details or a message if not found.
- update_todo_endpoint(id: String, new_text: String): Updates the text of a TODO item with the given ID. Returns a boolean indicating success.
- delete_todo_endpoint(id: String): Deletes a TODO item by its ID. Returns a boolean indicating success.
- check_len_endpoint(): Checks if there are any TODO items present in the list. Returns a boolean.

###Code Structure:

The code includes functions for managing TODO items and implementing the canister endpoints. 
Here's a breakdown:

- Todo struct: Represents a TODO item with id and text fields.
- get_todos and set_todos functions: Interact with canister storage to get and set the TODO list (uses storage::persistent and storage::stable from ic_cdk).
- Other functions: Add, read, update, and delete TODO items, handling logic and interacting with storage.
*-endpoint functions: Define query functions exposed by the canister.

###Note:

This code uses a placeholder for random ID generation. Replace it with a proper implementation in production.
